# Research for the 2019 Season
### If you are coming here and are confused as to why there is no code here or only outdated code, check the other branches than master!
## Branches
 * vision-prediction
   * vision-prediction has code that will be implemented to account for latency in the camera
 * master
   * has old vision code. Not used anymore but kept just in case.
 * limelight
   * pre-snailvision vision code can be found here
 * easypath
   * easypath allows paths for autonomous to be made quickly and easily and then used by the robot
 * double-solenoid
   * double-solenoid has code to test whether double solenoids work properly.
 * snail-vision
   * snail-vision is supposed to be a structure for vision that we could reuse for future years with all functionality we might ever need without having to adjust anything but tuning.
   * As of recently, snail-vision was moved to a repository of its own called snail-vision
